#​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ Project Statement

## Problem Statement

In particular, small, independent cafés and eateries typically depend on manual or paper-based methods for order taking and monitoring. This, in turn, results in the inefficient use of time, errors in calculation, and no open access to pending orders, thus making it difficult to understand what is going on during the rush hours. Order management through a simple, dedicated digital system is the only way to effectively track the steps from selection to fulfillment.

## Scope of the Project

This project is mainly about building a **standalone desktop application** to control the basic workflow of a café order system.

<strong>INCLUDED:</strong> Displaying the menu, creating new orders in real-time, calculating total prices, placing orders into a waiting queue, and changing the status of orders to finished.

<strong>EXCLUDED (Future Enhancements):</strong> Database persistence, multi-user support, receipt printing, inventory management, or payment gateways integration.

## Target Users

<strong>Café Staff/Cashiers:</strong> The main users, who will be operating the application, will be the staff members, or cashiers, in the café, who are responsible for taking new customer orders, placing them, and marking them as completed.

<strong>Café Owners/Managers:</strong> Users who get the most out of the organized pending order tracking to ensure that their service is delivered on time.

## High-Level Features

1. **Order Generation:** An easy-to-use interface that helps to create a new customer order.

2. **Order Finalization:** A tool that enables users to finish their current order and transfer it to a tracking system.

3. **Order Fulfillment:** A device to effectively follow up on completed orders and remove them from the waiting ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌list.
